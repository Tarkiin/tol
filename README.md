Discord Token Onliner

## Setup
1. `git clone https://github.com/xevaly/tol`
2. Put all your tokens into the `tokens.txt`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python main.py`
- (If you're on a VPS you probably want to make a screen with `screen -S <nameOfScreen>` and use `screen -xf <name>` to enter the screen)

### Follow me please, thanks
